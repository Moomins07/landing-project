# landing-project


This challenging, first 'big' project was completed over the course of around 3-4 hours. The completion of this website has allowed me to combine what I have learned over the course of the last week during the Odin Project curriculum. I have a greater understanding of flexbox and the use of divs as a simple yet effective way to establish space on my viewport through the use of padding and margins. 
Outside of just using code, I have specifically organised my code in a much more readable manner through the use of formatting and <!--/*note*/--> sections. 

I tried to use simple yet concise Git commits though I do not feel that I committed often enough and is an area for improvement. I feel that I also need to further develop my understanding of CSS units, specifically 'em' and 'rem'. 

Overall, I am very happy with the result and I'm looking forward to what comes next.
